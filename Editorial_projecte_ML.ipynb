    "To approach the analysis of these problems, I would choose the following algorithms and metrics:\n",
    "For audience segmentation and to see current demand: **K-means o DBSCAN:** Clustering algorithms. Ideal for segmenting audiences into groups that share similar characteristics, such as literary preferences, purchasing behavior or demographics. Analysis of Associations: **Apriori o FP-Growth**.\n",
    "For demand analysis of future trends: **Prophet (de Meta) o XGBoost:** Especially useful for time series when looking to analyze demand over time and find seasonal patterns (for example, higher sales during holidays or specific periods).\n",
    "Finally, to complement the prediction of trends and demand, a recommendation system can suggest which genres or authors to edit based on the reader's behavior: **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metrics I would choose to ensure the model is more accurate:\n",
    "**RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** To measure the error between predicted and actual values. It is especially useful when you want to penalize big mistakes.\n",
    "**MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** It provides a more intuitive measure of error, as it reflects the average magnitude of deviations between predictions and actual values.\n",
    "**RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination):** Measures how much of the variability in spending can be explained by the model.\n",
    "**Accuracy (precision):** Proportion of correct predictions with respect to the total. \n",
    "**F1-score:** Measures the balance between precision and sensitivity, especially useful if there is an imbalance in the classes.\n",
    "**Silhouette Score:** To measure how clearly differentiated the consumer groups are.\n",
    "**Entropy:** To evaluate the diversity within the clusters.\n",
    "**Gini Index:** To analyze the equity of sales between segments.\n",
    "**Support, confidence and lift:** To measure the strength of the associations and discovered rules.\n",
    "**Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):** To measure the relative error in the predictions.\n",
    "**Precision and Recall:** To evaluate the effectiveness of the model in correctly identifying trends in emerging genres/authors."
